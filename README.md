# Example Project

This repository contains a simple example project meant to demonstrate basic GitHub repository structure and documentation. The project is not tied to any specific application or framework. Instead, it serves as a template that can be adapted for learning purposes, testing workflows, or as a starting point for new ideas.

Inside this project you will find a minimal set of files that illustrate how to organize code, write documentation, and prepare a repository for sharing with others. You can clone this repository, experiment with changes, and expand it to suit your needs. The intent is to keep the structure clear and accessible so anyone can quickly understand how the project works.
